        <span><b>TakeABreak(android)</b> - a repeating interval alarm timer</span><br />
        <span class="book_paper_comment">compatibility: Android 2.2 APIs and above</span><br />
        <span>Motivation: I always forget time while sitting in front of the computer. 
        Therefore, I developed this mobile app to remind people like me to move around periodically, for better
        protection of their necks. It may also be used as an interval timer for biological experiments which require 
        repeated procedures.
        </span><br />
        <br />
        <span>The android.os.CountDownTimer is the core of the repeating timer. Two UIs are 
        provided for android phones before and after Android 3.0(HONYCOMB) for compatibility. 
        The app binds to mobile's notification ringtone. To change alarm sound, edit notification 
        alarm in the phone's sound setting </span>

        <span><b>TakeABreak(desktop)</b> - a repeating interval alarm timer</span><br />
        <span class="book_paper_comment">language: Java</span><br />
        <span>Motivation: This is the desktop version of TakeABreak for those who don't have android phones.
        </span><br />
        <br />
        <span>The timer is implemented via javax.swing.Timer. UI is based on javax.swing. 
        The javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem and javax.sound.sampled.Clip are used to play embedded
         ringtone. Timer interval can be entered by either direct typing or by clicking add/sub buttons.</span>

        <span><b>AutoClicker(desktop)</b> - a desktop auto-clicking tool</span><br />
        <span class="book_paper_comment">language: Java</span><br />
        <span>Motivation: To keep my <a href="http://clashofclans.wikia.com/">Clash of Clans</a> account online, 
        I developed this simple auto-clicker. The auto-clicker keeps clicking the indicated pixel on the screen, and 
        returns to the mouse's current working position. 
        </span><br />
        <br />
        <span>Change of clicking period and position is thread-safe and can be performed anytime. </span>
